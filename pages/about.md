Originally from a fine art background, it took me a while to get into the world of digital media, but as soon as I did, Flash became my tool of choice. For the first five years I worked as a freelance Flash developer, and I loved it! - and then, Steve Jobs decided to put the death curse on that tech. I didnt panic and luckily the company I worked for decided to plough ahead with converting their sites to be mobile friendly, which meant they needed to power up with the use of Javascript*. 

After wrestling with various JS frameworks including jQuery, Backbone, Knockout, Ember etc I finally moved on to the modern world of JS dev with Angular and then finally React. I now work developing modern javascript applications using all the cool tools that all the cool kids use :- React, Flux/Redux, ECMAScript 6/7, Yarn, Bable, Lerna, Docker etc etc. As well as all this I have dabbled and experimented with many other programming langauges and feel comfortable doing pretty much anything - from full scale backend java apps, to writing scripts with python and ruby. I would call my self someone who is happy to build anything with the tools that are available.

As a programmer I strive to create clean, re-usable Object Oriented code that is easy to maintain and easily extendable. I use agile methodologies for my large-scale projects, to ensure that project deadlines are met and to ensure a constant flow of workable iterative demos before final release.

I am an inquisitive thinker who has always wanted to find out how things work, and enjoyed building things for myself. This has aided me in my job as a developer, where I have enjoyed the challenge of using maths and technology to achieve results. 

As well as all this I am an avid keep fit nut and enjoy working out each day, either at the gym or on the bars I have set up in my garden. I also brew my own beer and sometimes enter in home brew competitions. So I think it is fair to say that I have a pretty busy and full life - I even have to fit my family in around all this some of the time also :)
